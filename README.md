## Why

- We need a demo frontend to show our work in [Algorand-NEAR-bridge](https://github.com/AbstrLabs/Algorand-NEAR-bridge) (Private)
- Possibly this can be a stand-alone version of the bridge.

## How to use

- This repo is hosted on [Half Moon Cross](http://www.halfmooncross.com/)
- Host on localhost with `yarn install && yarn start`
